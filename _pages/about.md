I am a PhD student in Latin American and Iberian Cultures at Columbia. In my dissertation, tentatively titled "Imaginaries of the Common in Contemporary Venezuela," I analyze how the political rationality of the common is expressed in aesthetics discourses and micro-political practices in Venezuela throughout the last decade.  Some other of my research interests include regimes of visuality and the circulation of precarious digital images in Latin America.
