I am a PhD student in Latin American and Iberian Cultures at Columbia. hold a Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communications from U. Monte√°vila in Caracas and a Master of Arts in Media Studies from The New School in New York. 

In my dissertation, tentatively titled "Imaginaries of the Common in Contemporary Venezuela," I analyze how the political rationality of the common is expressed in aesthetics discourses and micro-political practices in Venezuela throughout the last decade, touching upon questions of space and spirituality. Some other of my research interests include regimes of visuality and the circulation of precarious digital images in Latin America.
